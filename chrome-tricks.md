Some tricks which saved a lot of my time and countless repetitive clicks.
1. Alt-d-Enter shortcut to duplicate a tab
2. Goto a mobile site using F12 -> Ctrl-shift-M. Best example to this working is while using instagram.
3. On Linux systems, Ctrl-Shift-(PgUp/PgDn) moves your tabs to left/right respectively. Helpful to arrange tabs without dragging with your mouse.
